# Dictionary Check

This analyzer gathers all the parts of speech and displays them in a KB Display. This allowed for some cleanup of some old problems with the dictionary. This was a quick fix so that there should not be anything "strange" about all.dict.

## Retro-fitting

This could be used to retro-fix the attr1.kb, attr2.kb, etc. files but with the new dictionary system, it is probably no long needed or desired.
